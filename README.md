# YoutubeAPI
# ===========

# Introduction
This is a personal project to practice all the programming fundamentals that I already have while I learn how to use an API

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Google API Client

# How it's gonna work initially:

1. User enters a tag (e.g., "beginner").

2. Program searches YouTube videos (using API).

3. Filters videos whose tags include that term.

4. Outputs video links.
